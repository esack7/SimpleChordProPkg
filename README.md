# Simple ChordPro Package

An NPM package to convert song lyric and chords to and from the ChordPro format. This program does not implement the full ChordPro specification as detailed at https://www.chordpro.org/chordpro/. No ChordPro usage of meta-data is required, nor is it recognized by this program. This program simply takes a ```string``` in either a chord/lyric format or a ChordPro format and converts it to the other. There is also a built in functionality to transpose chords.

import { createCP, parseCP, transpose, keys } from simplechordpro;
